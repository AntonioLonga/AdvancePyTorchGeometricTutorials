# AdvancePyTorchGeometricTutorials
Hi! We are Antonio Longa PhD student, and PhD Gabriele Santin and PhD Giovanni Pellegrini, researcher, working between Fondazione Bruno Kessler and the University of Trento, Italy.

This project aims to present through a series of tutorials various techniques in the field of Geometric Deep Learning, focusing on how they work and how to implement them using the [Pytorch geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric)
library, an extension to Pytorch to deal with graphs and structured data,
developed by [@rusty1s](https://github.com/rusty1s).

You can find our video tutorials on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/94longa2112/featured) and at our official website [here.](https://antoniolonga.github.io/Advanced_PyG_tutorials/index.html)

Feel free to join our weekly online tutorial! For more details, have a look at the  [official website.](https://antoniolonga.github.io/Advanced_PyG_tutorials/index.html)
